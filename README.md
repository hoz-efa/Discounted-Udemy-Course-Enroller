### Using GitHub Actions

You can automate the script to run every 24 hours using GitHub Actions. Hereâ€™s how:

1. **Fork the Repository**: First, fork the repository to your GitHub account.

2. **Set Secrets**: In your forked repository, go to `Settings` > `Secrets` > `Actions` and add the required secrets (e.g., `UDEMY_EMAIL`, `UDEMY_PASSWORD`).

3. **Workflow File**: The repository already contains a GitHub Actions workflow file. You can view and edit it here: [GitHub Actions Workflow](https://github.com/hoz-efa/Discounted-Udemy-Course-Enroller/blob/cli/.github/workflows/ci.yml).

   - This workflow runs the script every 24 hours.
   - It uses the secrets you set in the repository settings.

### Deployment on Koyeb or Heroku

If you prefer not to use GitHub Actions, you can deploy this script on platforms like Koyeb or Heroku.

#### Deploying on Koyeb

1. **Create a New Service**: Log in to Koyeb, create a new service, and connect your GitHub repository.
2. **Set Environment Variables**: Add the required environment variables in the service settings.

#### Deploying on Heroku

1. **Create a New Application**: Log in to Heroku, create a new application, and connect your GitHub repository.
2. **Set Environment Variables**: Go to the "Settings" tab and set the required environment variables in the Config Vars section.
